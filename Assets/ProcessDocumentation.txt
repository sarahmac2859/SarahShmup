I forget what type of file we were supposed to add for this, so I think this is just a text document
that hopefully you can read. My game idea is Sewer Rat Cowboy, where you play as a cowboy who ended
up really small and shrank himself and his horse, so he rides through the sewers trying to escape the 
pipes while killing angry rats. This idea happened from picking random words in a breakout room and 
deciding this one was by far the weirdest.
